### 3DCG
As for 3DCG skills,  I prefer modeling inorganic objects such as cars and buildings.I am not good at character modeling/rigging and motion creation.My available 3DCG applications are as follows.

- Cinema4D
- Max
- Blender

```I liked Softimage, although it is no longer availableðŸ˜¢```

### AI
#### Image-generation AI
As for image generation AI, I often use `Midjourney` and occasionally use `Stable Diffusion` as an extension of my development skills. I am also interested in "DALL-E3" recently.

### SNS
- On IG, I post what I feel when I listen to my favorite music, along with artwork generated using image generation AI.Each post can be accompanied by music up to 90 seconds long, so I enjoy listening to the music that lines my profile grid every day.Please check out my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/nao_anm.msc.jpn/)ðŸ˜Š
