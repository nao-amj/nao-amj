ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m nao!On Instagram, I post what I feel when I listen to my favorite music, along with artwork generated using image generation AI.Each post can be accompanied by music up to 90 seconds long, so I enjoy listening to the music that lines my profile grid every day.

Please check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nao_anm.msc.jpn/)ðŸ˜Š

As for image generation AI, I often use "Midjourney" and occasionally use "Stable Diffusion" as an extension of my development skills. I am also interested in "DALL-E3" recently.
