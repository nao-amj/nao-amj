And here are some of the programming languages and technologies I would like to learn.
- `Rust`, `Go`( + `Flutter`),`WASM`, `HLSL`

### 3DCG
As for 3DCG skills,  I prefer modeling inorganic objects such as cars and buildings.I am not good at character modeling/rigging and motion creation.My available 3DCG applications are as follows.

- Cinema4D, Max, `Blender`

```I liked Softimage, although it is no longer available😢```

### AI
#### ChatGPT
`TODO`

#### Image-generation AI
As for image generation AI, I often use `Midjourney` and occasionally use `Stable Diffusion` as an extension of my development skills. I am also interested in `DALL-E3` recently.

---

### XR
- AR, VR, MR

`TODO`

---

### SNS
- On IG, I post what I feel when I listen to my favorite music, along with artwork generated using image generation AI.Each post can be accompanied by music up to 90 seconds long, so I enjoy listening to the music that lines my profile grid every day.Please check out my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/nao_anm.msc.jpn/)😊

`TODO`

### Pencil drawing
I started my practice in October 2023.

### English
I am learning to use `Instagram` to improve my English skills.(started in April 2023)
First, I used translation software (such as DeepL). On Instagram, comments and DMs are the main means of communication, especially DMs, which require speed instead of small granularity of sentences.Communicating through DMs is nerve-wracking, and the speed at which I can think of English on my own is gradually increasing.At the same time, I can learn words, phrases, and slang in parallel, so I feel that I have improved since started Instagram.
I am still continuing my efforts to improve my English skills (reading and writing) with this study method.My listening has improved a bit by listening to podcasts every day, but the problem is speaking. I need to figure out a good way to do this 😊.
