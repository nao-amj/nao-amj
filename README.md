#### Image-generation AI
As for image generation AI, I often use `Midjourney` and occasionally use `Stable Diffusion` as an extension of my development skills. I am also interested in `DALL-E3` recently.

### SNS
- On IG, I post what I feel when I listen to my favorite music, along with artwork generated using image generation AI.Each post can be accompanied by music up to 90 seconds long, so I enjoy listening to the music that lines my profile grid every day.Please check out my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/nao_anm.msc.jpn/)ðŸ˜Š

### English
I am learning to use `Instagram` to improve my English skills.(started in April 2023)
- I made a start by using translation software(e.g. DeepL). I thought it was important to start anyway.The main forms of communication on `Instagram` are through comments and DMs, and DMs in particular require speed in exchange for a smaller granularity of text.
- DM communication is nerve-wracking, and the rate at which I have to think about English on my own gradually increases. 
- At the same time, I can learn words, phrases, and slang in parallel, and feel that I have improved since started `Instagram`.
- With this study method, I am still continuing my efforts to improve my English skills (`reading` and `writing`).
- My `listening` has improved a little by listening to podcasts every day, but the problem is `speaking`. I want to think of a good way to do thisðŸ˜Š
