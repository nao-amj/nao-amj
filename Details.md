My name is nao. Let me introduce myself a little. I am the CTO and developer for an AI related company.
In my role as a developer, I don't have as much time for programming and design as I used to.

### Development
I have experience in PC app development, web development, and mobile app development. Recently, I have become addicted to image-generating AI and have fewer opportunities to develop, but want to enjoy creating games in `Unity` (`C#`) and `Python`.

- OS
  - `Windows`, `Mac`, `Linux`, `iOS`, `Android`, `ChromeOS` (+ `ChromeOS Flex`) 
- Programming Languages
  - `C#`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Swift`, `Kotlin`, `Objective-C`, `Java`, `PHP`, `C++`, `VisualBasic`, `Lua`
- Cloud
  - `AWS`, `GCP`, `Firebase`, `Azure`
- `Unity`, `Unreal Engine`, Web Framework(`Vue.js`, `React`, `Astro`), `Processing` 

And here are some of the programming languages and technologies I would like to learn.
- `Rust`, `Dart`( + `Flutter`),`WASM`, `HLSL`

### Pencil drawing
I started my practice in October 2023.

I originally loved to draw. As I became a working adult, I had fewer opportunities to paint, and I was wondering if there was anything I could do. In conclusion, I felt that hand-drawing skills such as pencils would be important for me in image generation by AI, so I started working on drawing pictures with pencils.

In my opinion, improving AI image generation skills will also improve pencil drawing skills, and vice versa. The reverse is also true.

#### What I think as of May 2024
It depends on the person as to how they utilize AI to generate images. In my case, I have been improving my knowledge and skills, but at this point I am not creating as many prompts as I used to.
Most of the time I use MidJourney's ‚ÄúVary(Region)‚Äù feature to work out the details in the process. In this case, handwriting skills and knowledge are important.

#### Progress on the way
I continue to post on my Instagram account dedicated to pencil drawings.

### English
To improve my English, I mainly use Instagram to study (starting April 2023).

#### Writing
First, I used translation software (e.g. DeepL). On Instagram, comments and DMs are the main means of communication, especially DMs require speed instead of small granularity of sentences. communication through DMs is nerve-wracking, so I am gradually improving my speed to think of English by myself. At the same time, I can learn words, phrases, and slang in parallel, so I feel I have improved since I started Instagram.

#### Listening
My listening skills have improved a bit by listening to podcasts every day.

#### Speaking
The problem is speaking skills. It is an area I am reluctant to work on because I don't get a chance to hone my skills very often and I am not very confident myself.
So in March 2024, I finally tried my hand at posting audio of my Instagram stories. I was very nervous but it was a great experience. I plan to force myself to speak and improve my skills.
